    <pre id="instructions">            Dear Sqaudron, 
            Welcome to the Quarky Universe!
            
            You have landed at the genesis of the ‘Quarky Clue Hunt’, one of the finest collection of ciphers and puzzles in the world and I am the director of this challenge. 
            As instructed, to earn your desired spot on your mission, you must face this challenge with utmost rigour and perseverance and come out as one of the top 10 performers amongst hundreds 
            of other skilled squadrons like yours. 
            I have compiled a list of few guidelines to aid you in your endeavour: 
            •    Use the credentials provided to you to log-in below to land on your first level, which will 
                 initiate the 5 hours timer within which you are required to complete the clue-hunt.
            •    There are 9 levels in this clue hunt, each of which are only reached after completing the previous one. 
            •    To progress to the next level, you must enter the final answer in the dialogue box at the middle of the page. 
            •    Upon special request from The International School for Space Science and Aviation, I have decided to 
                 grant you 4 lifelines (3 hints and 1 skip) to aid you along your way. 
            •    By opting for a hint, you will be provided with an adequate clue to progress in the round. 
                 The skip option will allow you to progress any round immediately. 
            •    In case you take a hint and then skip the level, your hint will be reimbursed to you.
            •    You must message any of my personnel on your Discord server for any assistance this list doesn’t provide you. 
            And finally, as a well-wish token, I would ask you to read your instructions and clues 
            diligently before you attempt to solve any level. 
            With that, I wish you a very best of luck and I hope you find what you seek. 
            
            Yours Sincerely,
            Seneca Crane</pre>
